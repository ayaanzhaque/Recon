In light of the recent events at the US Capitol, people have voiced concerns about the inadequate response of police in many situations. This can be highly attributed to a lack of proper preparation. Thus, we developed Recon, an application that predicts future crimes. Recon specifically highlights the best method to resolve a crime safely and efficiently, thus allowing for better preparation to de-escalate crime. Our interactive map answers four main questions: where crimes occur, when crimes occur, what types of crimes occur, and how the crime should be resolved.
